# How to make a Gant Chart with Matplotlib

This Gantt Chart was originally used for my masters dissertation as a way to portray deadlines. The gantt chart uses matplitlib's function hbar to the horizontal bars, then more features are added to enhance the plot. Please feel free to use and modify the code.

NOTE: The repo includes an excel file that is not used in the Jupyter Notebook but has been included in case someone prefers working with xlsx files.
